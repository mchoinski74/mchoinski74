- 👋 Hi, I’m @mchoinski74
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded circuits, Python and other goofy stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, and hopefully Python soon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment: I'm not sure that I have much to contribute.
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't like it when people reach for me
